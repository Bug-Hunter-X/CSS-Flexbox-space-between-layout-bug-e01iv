The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers:  .container { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; } .item { width: 30%; }  The issue is that the space-between distribution doesn't work correctly if the sum of the item widths exceeds the container's width. This can happen due to padding, borders, margins, or even default browser styles.  The items might overflow or not distribute properly.
